    "## Function: `schedule_surgeries`\n",
    "\n",
    "This function defines and solves an optimization model for scheduling surgeries over a specified horizon. It prioritizes surgeries based on patient waiting times and the urgency associated with each surgery type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `surgeries_df` (pandas DataFrame): Contains each surgery's details, including a unique identifier (`surgery_id`), the type (`surgery_type`), and the admitted date represented as a negative integer for days waited.\n",
    "- `surgery_type_attributes` (Dictionary): Stores attributes for each surgery type, such as expected duration (`duration`) and priority (`priority`).\n",
    "- `current_day` (Integer): The current day number, serving as the starting point for the scheduling period.\n",
    "- `original_capacities` (pandas DataFrame): The original available hours for each room on each day.\n",
    "- `current_capacities` (pandas DataFrame): The current available hours for each room, adjusted as surgeries are scheduled.\n",
    "- `days_ahead` (Integer): The number of days to include in the scheduling horizon.\n",
    "- `beta` (double): Value between 0-1 which influences how much we prioritize based on priority values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `scheduled_surgeries_df` (pandas DataFrame): Contains the scheduled surgeries with their assigned day and room.\n",
    "- `current_capacities` (pandas DataFrame): Updated to reflect the remaining capacities after scheduling.\n",
    "- `unscheduled_surgeries_df` (pandas DataFrame): Contains the surgeries not scheduled in the current iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to minimize the total weighted waiting time for all surgeries, thereby prioritizing urgent cases and those who have been waiting longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Minimize} \\sum_{s \\in S} \\sum_{d \\in D} \\sum_{r \\in R} x_{s,d,r} \\cdot \\beta \\cdot (\\text{days\\_waited}_s + (d - \\text{current\\_day})) \\cdot \\text{priority}_s\n",

    "- $S$ is the set of surgeries.\n",
    "- $D$ is the set of days in the scheduling horizon.\n",
    "- $R$ is the set of rooms.\n",
    "- $x_{s,d,r}$ is a binary decision variable indicating if surgery $s$ is scheduled in room $r$ on day $d$.\n",
    "- $\\text{days\\_waited}_s$ is the days waited since admission, with an offset to ensure no zero values.\n",
    "- $\\text{priority}_s$ is the priority level of the surgery.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Single Scheduling Constraint:** Each surgery is scheduled at most once within the scheduling horizon.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_{d \\in D} \\sum_{r \\in R} x_{s,d,r} \\leq 1 \\quad \\forall s \\in S\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Capacity Constraints:** The total duration of surgeries in each room on each day must not exceed the available capacity, with adjustments for next-day and subsequent-days scheduling.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_{s \\in S} x_{s,d,r} \\cdot \\text{duration}_s \\leq \\min(\\text{allowed\\_capacity}_{d,r}, \\text{current\\_capacity}_{d,r}) \\quad \\forall d \\in D, \\forall r \\in R\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\text{allowed\\_capacity}_{d,r}$ is either 90% or 20% of the original capacity of room $r$ on day $d$, depending on whether $d$ is the next day or a subsequent days till max look ahead days.\n",
    "- $\\text{current\\_capacity}_{d,r}$ is the remaining capacity for room $r$ on day $d$, updated as surgeries are scheduled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model is optimized using the Gurobi optimizer, and the function returns the detailed schedule of surgeries, the updated capacities, and the list of unscheduled surgeries for potential future scheduling.\n"
